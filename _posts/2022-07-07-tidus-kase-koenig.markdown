_Tidus Kase-Koenig (30) - early career_

a brilliant, but fog minded Vulpkanin, graduated by the skin of his teeth from the NT Engineering corps. Throughout childhood and early adult life, he was always prone to peer-pressure and mischief, getting into situations and trouble often. Struggling with the need for validation through others, and hopeful self-worth, the engineering corps was the first stable placement he landed on.

Always likes to tinker with things, learns best on the job, and the hard way unfortunately. Demonstrates clear talent and comfort with the things he knows well, yet nervous but persistent with that which he does not.

Panics easily when things get out of hand, and sometimes hides his failures through his fear of rejection or judgement from others. Is incredibly forgetful, often making multiple trips back and forth to his department to gather equipment, despite making a list then forgetting he had that in his back pocket too.

Tidus is a bit introverted, but loved to be the center of attention in his youth. Now, he desires more to be loved and validated by his friends and work colleagues, and has aspirations to be a leader some day, despite his mental struggles limiting his abilities.

Tidus loves to chat and joke, and willingly joins in on situations, which of those that turn for the worst will be also first to panic and fluster.
