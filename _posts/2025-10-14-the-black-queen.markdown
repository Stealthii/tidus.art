The Train—a fast-moving space station up in low planetary orbit, nowadays more of a social spot than the research station it was previously prized for. Tara slipped through the airlock into the bar, letting the chaotic clamor wash over her and smother the silence that haunted her mind. Anxiety and a strange, persistent loneliness had become her constant companions this week, still on forced leave by the psychiatrist. She claimed a vodka tonic from the bar, her eyes catching Fell's shape across the sea of strangers.

"Where have you been?" he asked as she approached.

"Training engineers, remember?" she returned, sliding into the seat opposite.

Fell, a skull-coyote vulpkanin, brooded over his drink, the ghost-lights in his sockets casting a muted, steady glow. Beside him, a silent kitsune girl with three sweeping tails surveyed the room with tranquil, unreadable eyes.

"I was never any good at engineering," Fell rumbled, picking up the thread of her comment. It wasn't a complaint, but a statement of fact.

Tara took a long, bracing swallow. "It's never about being 'good' at it," she said, voice rough. "It's about choosing when everything's burning and every option is the wrong one."

Fell shook his head, a crooked smile flickering across his muzzle. "So it's decisions, not knowledge. Got it." He nodded toward the half-set chessboard. "On that note." He started arranging the scattered pieces.

"Oh," Tara said flatly. "I'm playing, then."

Fell blinked, the lights in his sockets flickering once. "I mean... do you want to?"

She just nodded, pushing her king's pawn forward two squares without a word.

---

*How long had it been?* she wondered, watching Fell counter with his knight. She developed her pieces with a muscle memory that felt alien, her moves confident but misguided, a reckless press into the center of the board. She left a knight completely undefended. Realizing the blunder, she just shrugged. When Fell hesitated, she waved her mechanical hand dismissively. "I've made my choice." He took the piece.

Her own hand trembled as she reached for her queen.

"You alright over there?" the kitsune asked, her voice soft as velvet.

Tara stayed silent, her gaze fixed on the battlefield of black and white. Fell’s knight prowled closer, a silent threat to her back line. She castled king-side, her movements sharp with urgency.

Fell looked confused, the ghost-lights in his eyes brightening slightly. "Tara, you can take that back. I've got you in a triple fork. You just... ignored it."

"You have to live with your mistakes," she said, her eyes not leaving the board. "If I've learned anything this week, it's that."

Fell's concern was a weight in the air. "Do you want to talk about it?"

She felt his gaze on her but refused to meet it, offering only a slight shrug. "Maybe later." she said, as she watched him take her queen.

Tara’s moves turned wild, sacrificing bishop and rook for scraps of ground in a desperate, scattered attack. Fell castled queen-side, building a fortress as her army dwindled. When his rook invaded her back rank, she snatched it up, barely reacting, as if the loss meant nothing at all.

She missed the next trap completely, pushing a pawn forward absently. She muttered a curse in quiet Cygni Standard.

Fell’s voice was a low growl. "Are you sure you want to leave your bishop hanging?"

Tara’s expression was unnervingly placid. "That'd be the second one dead on my watch. Makes you realize every decision burns, even when the choices seem clear."

The kitsune girl looked up from the board, her golden eyes meeting Tara’s for the first time.

Fell leaned forward, his brow furrowed. "Are you sure this is about the game, Tara?"

He took her last bishop, putting her in check. She gripped her king tightly, the plastic pressing against her trembling hand, and slid it wordlessly into the corner.

Fell advanced his rook, challenging hers. A ghost of a smile flickered at the corners of Tara's eyes as she nudged her king forward, inviting the inevitable. Fell’s hand darted for his rook, claiming hers in a heartbeat. Tara only watched, unmoving.

She knew the end had come, but still claimed his rook with her king—a final, defiant gesture.

Fell smiled, his eyes dimmed as he slid the black queen forward. "Mate," he said softly.

---

A peculiar calm washed over Tara. The bar noise receded, just for a heartbeat. She tugged her mask down and finished her drink in one long pull.

"That's another win," the kitsune murmured to Fell.

"Well," Tara began, her voice even. "I kept going. Let's see..." She began arranging her captured pieces in a neat line. Fell tilted his head, curious. "That's me," she said, tapping the white king. Her gaze locked on the pieces. "Here are the CMO and the Mystagogue who quit after I treated them badly," she added, her fingertips brushing against the two lost bishops. Fell's ears drooped, the light in his sockets shrinking to a faint ember.

"The two engineers who turned to dust in the crystal," she continued, nodding at a pair of pawns. The kitsune girl pulled her hood up, obscuring her face.

"Iris," Tara named her fallen queen. She flicked the two knights with her thumb. "Aenus. And my brother."

Fell was staring at her now, his head lowered. Tara took a last look at the board, eyes resting on the piece that had sealed her fate—Fell's black queen, looming over her defeated king. "That's all I have left," she said with a hollow smile. She glanced out the reinforced window at a shadekin sticking a luminescent snail to the glass. "*The Black Queen... she'd like that-*" she whispered to herself, eyes half closed, the image of an IPC filling her mind, red eyes shining through her eyelids like radiation.

Tara turned back to the table, her expression suddenly, jarringly cheerful. "So anyway, how's your week been?"

The other two exchanged a look of bewilderment.

"Long," Fell finally replied, his voice strained. He pushed himself up from the table, swaying slightly and placing a hand on its edge to steady himself. "My energy's sapped. I think I'm going to... sleep for a bit." The lights in his eyes flickered weakly as he gave a slow nod to them both before weaving his way through the crowded bar.

Tara slipped into Fell’s empty seat beside the kitsune, the silence between them thick and uncertain. She broke it with a nod at the girl’s suit—a purple-tinted twin to her own, but cut for three graceful tails. "I didn’t catch your name," she ventured.

"...Rin," she replied quietly.

"Rin," Tara repeated.

Rin seemed nervous. "...Just Rin."

"Just Rin," Tara echoed, nodding. "I'm..." She glanced at her mismatched hands—one living, one battered chrome. Tears threatened, but she met Rin’s gaze, unguarded. "*Nat,*" she whispered.

A soft smile graced Rin's lips. "Well, nice to meet you Nat."

It was nothing compared to the beam that shone back at her.

---

"Likewise," Nat replied. "So... what brings you to the train, then?"

Rin rubbed the back of her neck. "Well, I needed a break from the last shift," she sighed. "What a shit show."

Nat gave a small nod, watching as a courier threaded through the crowd to hand Rin a slim, flat parcel. "Some would call it a living," she said.

Rin tore the package open, her face splitting into a wolfish grin as she brandished a gleaming new butcher’s cleaver. "Ooh," she laughed, weighing it in her hand.

"Fan of yours?" Nat asked, spinning her mechanical hand in a small circle.

Rin whispered, almost to herself, "*Nice try, Kurogane...*" She glanced back at Nat and tucked the cleaver away. "Not important."

"Nothing really is," Nat murmured, her eyes drifting back to her empty glass.

"Importance is a variable thing."

"It’s all self-made," Nat shrugged, glancing at the chessboard. "Enjoyment too. In the end, we’re just pieces on someone else’s board."

Rin nodded, her eyes turning to the viewport. "To be used and played."

"Yep," Nat agreed. She watched Rin gaze out the window, then added, "Fell’s a strange one. I still can’t figure him out."

"Hasn't stuck a knife in my stomach yet," Rin replied, her grin returning. "So that's a good vote so far."

Nat let out a short laugh. "Yeah... this game’s a real joke sometimes."

"What, chess?"

"Yeah. No matter how you play, someone loses. Sometimes, everyone does."

Rin shrugged. "That's the point."

"Even the winner walks away missing something," Nat mused, gesturing at the scattered pieces. "Was any of it worth it, though?"

"Depends on who you ask."

A blush crept up Nat's neck, coloring her cheeks. Rin noticed, her eyes widening. "Is there a reason you’re starting to match your hair?"

Nat's eyes narrowed, her voice dropping to a whisper. "*I just wonder... if I'd never played, where would everyone be now?*" Her words faded into the noise.

Rin looked away. "That's the question, isn't it?" she said quietly. "Shit advice, but I choose not to care about much. Makes it easier to cut and run."

Nat just looked at her.

"Sometimes literally," Rin added, a fleeting glance at where she'd stowed the cleaver.

"That’s been my whole life," Nat said, her voice empty. "But it never stopped the pain from before."

Rin’s eyes dropped to her tails as she frowned, lighting a cigarette. Smoke curled around her as Nat reached for the black queen, cradling it in her palm and tracing its edges with her thumb.

"*I hope it was all worth it...*" she whispered to herself, her voice cracking. "*Until I'm taken too.*"

Rin looked at her cigarette packet. "Got three left..." She offered one to Nat, but she shook her head, looking at the door.

"Never picked up the habit," she said, meeting Rin’s gaze. "Hope we talk again. I think Fell would like that too."

"He never told me to leave."

"Yeah. People need someone they don't push away." Nat closed her fist around the queen. "Trust me. I've been on this road. And I've seen where it ends. Sometimes you need the opposite perspective to hang onto yourself."

Rin pondered this, taking a long drag. "Why not."

"Well, 'just Rin,'" Nat said, rising from the table and extending her human hand. "It’s been a pleasure."

Rin just looked at the outstretched hand. "Not one for touch."

Nat let her hand linger a moment, then pulled it back. "Neither was I, once."

She turned toward the exit, slipping the black queen into her pocket. That’s when she noticed Declan, sitting alone, eyes fixed on his table.

"Now there's one I haven't seen in a while."

Declan looked up, his expression preoccupied and grim. "Good day," he said, his voice flat.

Nat recognized the look. "It's okay," she said softly. "Look after yourself, Declan."

"Aye," he replied, his gaze already returning to the table. "Same tae ya, Tara."

Nat gave his shoulder a gentle pat before leaving the bar, the black queen’s weight a silent anchor in her pocket.
