The Train — a fast-moving space station up in low planetary orbit — was these days more of a social spot than the research station it was previously prized for. Tara slipped through the airlock into the bar, whose unfamiliar racket promised to drown out the now familiar silence in her head. Anxiety and a strange, persistent loneliness had become her constant companions this week, her off-duty ID clung to her belt, still on forced leave by the station psychiatrist. She claimed a vodka tonic from the bar, her eyes catching Fell's shape across the sea of strangers.

"Where have you been?" he asked as she approached.

"Training engineers, remember?" she returned, sliding into the seat opposite.

Fell, a skull-coyote vulpkanin, brooded over his drink, the ghost-lights in his sockets casting a muted, steady glow. Beside him, a silent kitsune girl with three sweeping tails surveyed the room with tranquil eyes.

"I was never any good at engineering," Fell rumbled, picking up the thread of her comment. It wasn't a complaint, but a statement of fact.

Tara took a long swallow of her drink. "It's not about being 'good' at it," she replied, clearing her throat. "It's about making a decision when everything's on fire and you have no good options."

Fell shook his head, a wry smile touching his muzzle. "Decisions, not knowledge. Right." He gestured to a half-arranged chessboard on the table. "Speaking of which." He began setting up the remaining pieces.

"Oh," Tara responded, raising an eyebrow. "I guess I'm playing."

Fell blinked, the lights in his sockets flickering once. "I mean... do you want to?"

She just nodded, pushing her king's pawn forward two squares without a word.

---

*How long had it been?* she wondered, watching Fell counter with his knight. She developed her pieces with a muscle memory that felt alien, her moves confident but misguided, a reckless press into the center of the board. She left a knight completely undefended. Realizing the blunder, she just shrugged. When Fell hesitated, she waved her mechanical hand dismissively. "I've made my choice." He took the piece.

Her own hand trembled as she reached for her queen.

"You alright over there?" the kitsune asked, her voice soft as velvet.

Tara didn't answer, her gaze fixed on the board. Fell’s knight advanced, a predator closing in on her back line. She castled king-side, in a move of desperation.

Fell looked confused, the ghost-lights in his eyes brightening slightly. "Tara, you can take that back. I've got you in a triple fork. You just... ignored it."

"You have to live with your mistakes," she said, her eyes not leaving the board. "If I've learned anything this week, it's that."

Fell's concern was a weight in the air. "Do you want to talk about it?"

She felt his gaze on her but refused to meet it, offering only a slight shrug. "Maybe later." she said, as she watched him take her queen.

Tara's play grew more erratic. She sacrificed a bishop and a rook for minor positional gains. Fell queen-side castled into a fortress. More of her pieces vanished from the board. When one of Fell's rooks slid onto her back rank, she captured it with her own without a second thought.

She missed the next trap completely, pushing a pawn forward absently. She muttered a curse in quiet Cygni Standard.

Fell’s voice was a low growl. "Are you sure you want to leave your bishop hanging?"

Tara’s expression was unnervingly placid. "That'd be the second one down on my watch. So, yeah."

The kitsune girl looked up from the board, her golden eyes meeting Tara’s for the first time.

Fell leaned forward, his brow furrowed. "Are you sure this is about the game, Tara?"

He took her last bishop, putting her in check. She gripped her king tightly, the plastic pressing against her trembling hand, and slid it wordlessly into the corner.

Fell advanced his rook, challenging hers. A ghost of a smile flickered at the corners of Tara's eyes as she nudged her king forward, inviting the inevitable. Fell’s hand darted for his rook, claiming hers in a heartbeat. Tara only watched, unmoving. -- TODO

She knew it was over, taking his rook with her king in protest.

Fell smiled, his eyes dimmed as he slid the black queen forward. "Mate," he said softly.

---

A peculiar calm washed over Tara. The bar noise receded, just for a heartbeat. She tugged her mask down and finished her drink in one long pull.

"That's another win," the kitsune murmured to Fell.

"Well," Tara began, her voice even. "I kept going. Let's see..." She began arranging her captured pieces in a neat line. Fell tilted his head, curious. "That's me," she said, tapping the white king. Her gaze locked on the pieces. "Here are the CMO and the Mystagogue who quit after I treated them badly," she added, her fingertips brushing against the two lost bishops. Fell's ears drooped, the light in his sockets shrinking to a faint ember.

"The two engineers who turned to dust in the crystal," she continued, nodding at a pair of pawns. The kitsune girl pulled her hood up, obscuring her face.

"Iris," Tara named her fallen queen. She flicked the two knights with her thumb. "Aenus. And my brother."

Fell was staring at her now, his head lowered. Tara took one last look at the board, her eyes resting on the piece that had sealed her fate — Fell's black queen, looming over her defeated king. "That's all I have left," she said with a hollow smile. She glanced out the reinforced window at a shadekin sticking a luminescent snail to the glass. "*The Black Queen... she'd like that-*" she whispered to herself, eyes half closed, the image of an IPC filling her mind, red eyes shining through her eyelids like radiation.

Tara looks up from the board, her expression suddenly, jarringly cheerful. "So anyway, how's your week been?"

The other two exchanged a look of bewilderment.

"Long," Fell finally replied, his voice strained. He pushed himself up from the table, swaying slightly and placing a hand on its edge to steady himself. "My energy's sapped. I think I'm going to... sleep for a bit." The lights in his eyes flickered weakly as he gave a slow nod to them both before weaving his way through the crowded bar.

Tara moved into the seat he'd vacated, next to the kitsune. They sat in an awkward silence. "I didn't catch your name," Tara said, glancing at the purple-tinted suit the girl wore that matched her own, albeit tailored to accommodate three elegant tails.

"...Rin," she replied quietly.

"Rin," Tara repeated.

Rin seemed nervous. "...Just Rin."

"Just Rin," Tara nodded. "I'm..." She looked down at her hands, one of flesh and blood, the other a worn, scratched chrome. A flood of memories — not from the past week, but from a lifetime before, washed over her. She looked back up at Rin with glassy eyes, her expression vulnerable. "Nat."

A soft smile graced Rin's lips. "Well, nice to meet you Nat."

It was nothing compared to the beam that shone back at her.

---

"Likewise," Nat replied. "So... the Train, then?"

Rin rubbed the back of her neck. "Well, I needed a break from the last shift," she sighed. "What a shit show."

Nat gave a small nod, watching as a courier threaded through the crowd to hand Rin a slim, flat parcel. "Some would call it a living," she said.

Rin tore the package open, her face splitting into a wolfish grin as she brandished a gleaming new butcher’s cleaver. "Ooh," she laughed, weighing it in her hand.

"Fan of yours?" Nat asked, spinning her mechanical hand in a small circle.

Rin whispered, almost to herself, "*Nice try, Kurogane...*" She glanced back at Nat and tucked the cleaver away. "Not important."

"Nothing really is," Nat murmured, her eyes drifting back to her empty glass.

"Importance is a variable thing."

"It’s all self-made," Nat shrugged, glancing at the chessboard. "Enjoyment too. In the end, we’re just pieces on someone else’s board."

Rin nodded, her eyes turning to the viewport. "To be used and played."

"Yep," Nat agreed. She watched Rin gaze out the window, then added, "Fell’s a strange one. I still can’t figure him out."

"Hasn't stuck a knife in my stomach yet," Rin replied, her grin returning. "So that's a good vote so far."

Nat let out a short laugh. "Yeah... this game’s a real joke sometimes."

"What, chess?"

"Yeah. No matter how you play, someone loses. Sometimes, everyone does."

Rin shrugged. "That's the point."

"Even the winner walks away missing something," Nat mused, gesturing at the scattered pieces. "Was any of it worth it, though?"

"Depends on who you ask."

A blush crept up Nat's neck, coloring her cheeks. Rin noticed, her eyes widening. "Is there a reason you’re starting to match your hair?"

Nat's eyes narrowed, her voice dropping to a whisper. "*I just wonder... if I'd never played, where would everyone be now?*" Her words faded into the noise.

Rin looked away. "That's the question, isn't it?" she said quietly. "Shit advice, but I choose not to care about much. Makes it easier to cut and run."

Nat just looked at her.

"Sometimes literally," Rin added, a fleeting glance at where she'd stowed the cleaver.

"That’s been my whole life," Nat said, her voice empty. "But it never stopped the pain from before."

Rin’s eyes dropped to her tails as she frowned, lighting a cigarette. Smoke curled around her as Nat reached for the black queen, cradling it in her palm and tracing its edges with her thumb.

"*I hope it was all worth it...*" she whispered to herself, her voice cracking. "*Until I'm taken too.*"

Rin looked at her cigarette packet. "Got three left..." She offered one to Nat, but she shook her head, looking at the door.

"Never picked up the habit," she said, meeting Rin’s gaze. "Hope we talk again. I think Fell would like that too."

"He never told me to leave."

"Yeah. People need someone they don't push away." Nat closed her fist around the queen. "Trust me. I've been on this road. And I've seen where it ends. Sometimes you need the opposite perspective to hang onto yourself."

Rin pondered this, taking a long drag. "Why not."

"Well, 'just Rin,'" Nat said, rising from the table and extending her human hand. "It’s been a pleasure."

Rin just looked at the outstretched hand. "Not one for touch."

Nat let her hand linger a moment, then pulled it back. "Neither was I, once."

She turned toward the exit, slipping the black queen into her pocket. That’s when she noticed Declan, sitting alone, eyes fixed on his table.

"Now there's one I haven't seen in a while."

Declan looked up, his expression preoccupied and grim. "Good day," he said, his voice flat.

Nat recognized the look. "It's okay," she said softly. "Look after yourself, Declan."

"Aye," he replied, his gaze already returning to the table. "Same tae ya, Tara."

Nat gave his shoulder a gentle pat before leaving the bar, the black queen’s weight a silent anchor in her pocket.
