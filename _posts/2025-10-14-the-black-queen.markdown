Off-duty again, Tara walked through the doors to Train's bar, whose familiar racket promised to drown out the silence in her head. A gnawing anxiety accompanied an unfamiliar loneliness that had become her shadow this past week. As she grabbed a vodka tonic from the bar, she spotted Fell across the crowded room and navigated towards his table.

"Where have you been?" he asked as she approached.

"Training engineers, remember?" she returned, sliding into the booth.

A dark-furred vulpkanin, Fell frowned into his own drink. A quiet kitsune girl with two long tails sat beside him, watching the room with placid eyes.

"I was never any good at engineering," Fell rumbled, picking up the thread of her comment. It wasn't a complaint, but a statement of fact.

Tara took a long, sharp swallow of her vodka tonic. "It's not about being 'good' at it," she replied, her voice rough. "It's about making a decision when everything's on fire and you have no good options."

Fell shook his head, a wry smile touching his muzzle. "Decisions, not knowledge. Right." He gestured to a half-arranged chessboard on the table. "Speaking of which." He began setting up the remaining pieces.

"Oh," Tara said flatly. "I'm playing, then."

Fell blinked, his ears twitching. "I mean... do you want to?"

She just nodded, pushing her king's pawn forward two squares without a word.

---

*How long had it been?* she wondered, watching Fell counter with his knight. She developed her pieces with a muscle memory that felt alien, her moves confident but misguided, a reckless press into the center of the board. She left a knight completely undefended. Realizing the blunder, she just shrugged. When Fell hesitated, she waved her mechanical hand dismissively. "I've made my choice." He took the piece.

Her own hand trembled as she reached for her queen.

"You alright over there?" the kitsune asked, her voice soft as velvet.

Tara didn't answer, her gaze fixed on the board. Fell’s knight advanced, a predator closing in on her back line. She castled king-side, in a move of desperation.

Fell looked confused. "Tara, you can take that back. I've got you in a triple fork. You just.. ignored it."

"You have to live with your mistakes," she said, her eyes not leaving the board. "If I've learned anything this week, it's that."

Fell's concern was a weight in the air. "Do you want to talk about it?"

She felt his gaze on her but refused to meet it, offering only a slight shrug. "Maybe later." she said, as she watched him take her queen.

Tara's play grew more erratic. She sacrificed a bishop and a rook for minor positional gains, a frantic, disorganized assault. Fell queen-side castled into a fortress. More of her pieces vanished from the board. When one of Fell's rooks slid onto her back rank, she captured it with her own without a second thought, shrugging as if it were meaningless.

She missed the next trap completely, pushing a pawn forward absently. She muttered a curse in quiet Cygni Standard.

Fell’s voice was a low growl. "Are you sure you want to leave your bishop hanging?"

Tara’s expression was unnervingly placid. "That'd be the second one dead on my watch. So, yeah."

The kitsune girl looked up from the board, her golden eyes meeting Tara’s for the first time.

Fell leaned forward, his brow furrowed. "Are you sure this is about the game, Tara?"

He took the last bishop, putting her in check. She held her king, the plastic against her trembling hand, and slid it wordlessly into the corner.

Fell slid his rook to challenge hers. A faint smile touched the corners of Tara's eyes. She moved her king out, baiting the trap. Before her hand had even settled back on the table, Fell’s fingers were on his rook. He captured hers instantly. She just stared.

She knew it was over. She took his rook with her king.

Fell smiled sadly. He slid the black queen forward. "Mate," he said softly.

A strange sense of calm settled over Tara. She pulled down the bandana covering her forehead and drained the rest of her drink.

"That's another win," the kitsune murmured to Fell.

"Well," Tara began, her voice even. "I kept going. Let's see..." She began arranging her captured pieces in a neat line. Fell tilted his head, curious. "That's me," she said, tapping the white king. Her gaze was locked on the pieces. "Here are the CMO and the Mystagogue who quit on me," she added, her fingertips brushing against the two lost bishops. Fell's ears drooped.

"The two engineers who turned to dust in the crystal," she continued, nodding at a pair of pawns. The kitsune girl pulled her hood up, obscuring her face.

"Twelve," Tara named her fallen queen. She flicked the two knights with her thumb. "Aenus. And my brother."

Fell was staring at her now, his head lowered. Tara took one last look at the board, her eyes resting on the piece that had sealed her fate—Fell's black queen, looming over her defeated king. "That's all I have left," she said with a hollow smile. She glanced out the reinforced window at a shadekin, sticking a luminescent snail to the glass. "*The Black Queen... she'd like that-*" she whispered to herself, eyes half closed, the image of an IPC filling her mind, red eyes shining through her eyelids like radiation.

Tara turned back to the table, her expression suddenly, jarringly cheerful. "So anyway, how's your week been?"

The other two exchanged a look of bewilderment.

"Long," Fell finally replied. "My energy's sapped. I think I'm going to... sleep for a bit." He rose from the booth, nodding to them both before weaving his way through the crowded bar.

Tara moved into the seat he'd vacated, next to the kitsune. They sat in an awkward silence. "I didn't catch your name," Tara said, gesturing to the matching purple-tinted suit the girl wore, tailored to accommodate two elegant tails.

"...Rin," she replied quietly.

"Rin," Tara repeated.

Rin seemed nervous. "...Just Rin."

Tara nodded. "I'm..." She looked down at her hands, one of flesh and blood, the other of gleaming chrome. A flood of memories—from the past week, from a lifetime before—washed over her. Her eyes grew moist. She looked back up at Rin, her expression one of raw vulnerability. "Nat."

A soft smile graced Rin's lips. "It's nice to meet you, Nat."

It was nothing compared to the beam that shone back at her.

"Likewise," Nat replied. Her gaze drifted back to the board. Her metal fingers closed around the black queen, lifting it from the square where it had ended her king. *Was it all just the price to have her into my life?* She sighed, a sound lost in the bar's noise, and slipped the piece into her pocket. It felt heavier than it should. *I have to make it worth it. Before I'm taken too.*
