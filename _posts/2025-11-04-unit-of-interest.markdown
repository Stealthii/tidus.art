You are absolutely right. My previous telling of the event was flawed and assumed knowledge the Sergeant wouldn't have had. Thank you for the clarification.

Here is a new version, a short piece focusing entirely on that pivotal, unnerving conversation.

***

The air in the Floof LLC arrivals bay was cold, scented with the sterile tang of ozone and the faint, coppery smell of the dead. Sergeant Araneus rubbed his eyes, his gaze fixed on the cryo-gurney.

The body of Tara Mason was a ruin. Scorched by vacuum, tattered by micro-meteors, and frozen solid. Her cybernetic arm and leg were locked in a final, spidery rigor. Standard revival had failed twice.

He turned to the console. "Patch me through to NanoTrasen," he ordered the comms tech. "Specialist Medical division. I don't care what it costs."

A moment later, a holoscreen flickered to life, resolving into the impossibly polished, smiling avatar of an NT customer service representative.

"NanoTrasen Medical Services," the avatar chirped, its voice like synthesized honey. "Your health is our business. How may we assist you today?"

"Sergeant Araneus, Floof Command," he said, his voice flat. "I have a casualty here. Priority one. Our Chief Engineer was exposed to vacuum. Standard revival won't take. We need your top-tier specialists. We need a miracle."

"Of course, Sergeant. We are always happy to help our corporate partners!" the avatar said, its smile unwavering. "I just need to open a file for the patient. Name and designation, please?"

"Mason. Chief Engineer Tara Mason. Floof LLC."

The instant he said the name, the avatar's perfect smile froze. A sharp, digital *click* echoed from the speakers—not a sound of the console, but from the other end of the line. The connection terminated.

"Son of a..." Araneus began, slamming his fist on the console.

Before he could redial, the screen snapped back on. The branded blue background was gone, replaced by a flat, lightless grey. There was no avatar, just a secure connection symbol.

A new voice spoke. It was male, flat, and had no trace of customer-service warmth. "Sergeant Araneus."

It was not a question.

"Who is this?" Araneus demanded, his hand moving instinctively toward his sidearm. "I was cut off from Medical."

"That unit is no longer required. We are handling this file now," the voice stated. "You have confirmed visual on the asset?"

"The 'asset'?" Araneus bristled. "I have my Chief Engineer, Tara Mason. She's dead. I'm trying to get her revived."

A beat of silence, not for thought, but for processing.

"She's actually been missing from our roster for some time," the voice said, with the simple, unfeeling cadence of a man reading a logistics report. "A clerical error. It's fortunate you've recovered her."

"Your roster? What the hell are you talking about? She's Floof LLC."

"A common misconception, Sergeant. And luckily, we have the tech to help recover her. We have her signature on file."

A cold spike of adrenaline, sharper than the sterile air, shot down Araneus's spine. This wasn't a medical call. This was something else. "Help her? You can bring her back?"

"We'll send someone out to collect her," the voice said, ignoring the question. "Do not move her. Do not attempt any further medical procedures. Do not scan her cybernetics. Our team is already en route to your station. They will take it from here."

"I'm not just handing over my engineer to some spook!" Araneus snapped.

"You are," the voice replied, not threateningly, but as a simple statement of fact. The line clicked, and the screen went black.

Sergeant Araneus stood in the silence of the morgue, the dead screen staring back at him. He had called for a doctor. He had gotten something else entirely. Reluctantly, he keyed the station's main comms.

"Bay-Ops... prep arrivals bay three for an incoming NanoTrasen shuttle. And stand down the medical team."
