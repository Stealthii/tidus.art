**Never Become A Traitor**
*by Tide Mason*

----

It was a normal shift like any other. "Good Morning, team!", Mike sang through the headset. Mike Spike, one of the station's greatest Chief Engineers, the one who singlehandedly trained me and my fellow crew, and made the day a bright one, no matter the situation. But it wasn't a bright day. This young vulpkanin had accepted a contract with the Syndicate. Pay was limited, and times were tough aboard the station.


----

The PDA beeped. "Your mission is a simple one. Kill the Chief Engineer, steal their advanced boots, and escape to our headquarters without being noticed." I sat there, stunned. Simple? Kill Mike? What had I done? No - this was a dark day. I could not concentrate. Between the work my shift demanded of me, and trying to find the other traitors.. it was all too much. A fellow atmos tech was a traitor too, but not the electrician friend I grew up with. No.. he would never be stupid enough to do this.

----


The fellow traitor had hatched a plan to get us alone with the chief in Atmospherics. "AI compromised", he said. "Camera's have been disabled.". Mike nodded. "Great work, you three. Listen.. We've been through a lot today." He points at me, and my friend from the academy. "You two.. are like sons to me." My jaw dropped. A tear formed in my eye. Before I had time to think, or even respond, with a huge swing the atmospherics technician brings a fire axe down on the chief's head.

----


It was chaos. I dragged my friend away from the bloodbath, screaming and scratching at my face. "How could you.." he cried. I was crying too. I couldn't kill my chief, but I couldn't let my friend get hurt either. In the midst of the panic, spiders had emerged from the anomaly, and we were toast. The next thing I remember is waking up in a Command hospital. I look beside me and see the chief, in critical care. But he was stable.

----

I never got paid. I never saw my friend again. Luckily, no-one knew that I was involved, and I swore never to be a traitor to the corporation again. I may not like their practices, but the price to pay to be a traitor to your friends and your crew.. is greater than a paycheck.
